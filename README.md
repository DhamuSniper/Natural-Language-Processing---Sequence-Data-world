# Natural Language Processing

In this data world, sequence data is one of the challenging thing to get processed. But fortunately Deep neural networks helps us to process this data and ease the way to get valuable results.

NLP has a wide range of applications like, 

                                         * Speech Recognition
                                         * Dialog Systems
                                         * Sentiment Analysis
                                         * Machine Translation
                                         * Video Activity Recognition
                                         * Name Entity Recognition
                                         * Creation of Question and Answers with Distraction for MCQ based tests
                                         * and Many more...
                                         
To learn NLP, We must master RNN - Recurrent Neural Networks. I designed this repo something like this( Thanks to Standford CheatSheet )
